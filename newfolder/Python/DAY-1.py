Question:1
What is python??
Ans:
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.

What can Python do?
Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Why Python?
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.
Good to know
The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. 
However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything 
other than security updates, is still quite popular.
In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. 
It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly 
useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes.
Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
How to install the python in your pc:
1.Click Python Download.
2.Click the Windows link (two lines below the Download Python 3.7.4 button). The following page will appear in your browser
3.Click on the Download Windows x86-64 executable installer link under the top-left Stable Releases.
The following pop-up window titled Opening python-3.74-amd64.exe will appear.
Click the Save File button.
The file named python-3.7.4-amd64.exe should start downloading into your standard download folder. 
This file is about 30 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 10 seconds over a cable modem).
The file should appear as
4.Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Python (and reinstall it easily later, if necessary).
5.Feel free to explore this webpage further; if you want to just continue the installation, you can terminate the tab browsing this webpage.
6.Installing
Double-click the icon labeling the file python-3.7.4-amd64.exe.
A Python 3.7.4 (64-bit) Setup pop-up window will appear.



Ensure that the Install launcher for all users (recommended) and the Add Python 3.7 to PATH checkboxes at the bottom are checked.

If the Python Installer finds an earlier version of Python installed on your computer, the Install Now message may instead appear as Upgrade Now (and the checkboxes will not appear).

Highlight the Install Now (or Upgrade Now) message, and then click it.
When run, a User Account Control pop-up window may appear on your screen. I could not capture its image, but it asks, Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device.

Click the Yes button.
A new Python 3.7.4 (64-bit) Setup pop-up window will appear with a Setup Progress message and a progress bar.



During installation, it will show the various components it is installing and move the progress bar towards completion. Soon, a new Python 3.7.4 (64-bit) Setup pop-up window will appear with a Setup was successfuly message.



Click the Close button.
Python should now be installed.

Verifying
To try to verify installation,
Navigate to the directory C:\Users\Pattis\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37 (or to whatever directory Python was installed: see the pop-up window for Installing step 3).
Double-click the icon/file python.exe.
The following pop-up window will appear.



A pop-up window with the title C:\Users\Pattis\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python.exe appears, and inside the window; on the first line is the text Python 3.7.4 ... (notice that it should also say 64 bit). Inside the window, at the bottom left, is the prompt >>>: type exit() to this prompt and press enter to terminate Python.

You should keep the file python-3.7.4.exe somewhere on your computer in case you need to reinstall Python (not likely necessary).

You may now follow the instructions to download and install Java (you should have already installed Java, but if you haven't, it is OK to do so now, so long as you install both Python and Java before you install Eclipse), and then follows the instruction to download and install the Eclipse IDE. Note: you need to download/install Java even if you are using Eclipse only for Python)

Start the Installing instructions directly below.


Question:2
What is code Environment? and thier types.
Ans:
Python… the most popular and favorite programming language in the world for programmers of all age groups. If you are a beginner this language is strongly recommended to learn first. Well, In programming, we all know the importance of code editor and IDEs to write our program and to execute it but choosing the best code editor or IDE is always a confusing question. Understand that the best code editor or IDE depends on so many things such as programming language, project type, project size, OS support and considering a lot of other features. If we talk about Python so this language is also not an exception.



We are going to discuss the code editor or IDEs for Python to use in 2020. This information is going to be based on the opinion given by experienced developers, public web data, some previous surveys like Python Developers Survey 2018 Results / Editors and IDEs and the most important person Guido van Rossum (Python Creator). Firstly understand that IDE and code editor both are different things.

Text/Code Editor: Code editors are the lightweight tool that allows you to write and edit the code with some features such as syntax highlighting and code formatting. It provided fewer features than IDE.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): IDEs are full-fledged environment which provide all the essential tools needed for software development. It just doesn’t handle the code (for example, write, edit, syntax highlighting and auto-completion) but also provides other features such as debugging, execution, testing, and code formatting that helps programmers.
Let’s start with some overview of the best code editor based on certain terms…

What is Your Level?




Beginner — IDLE (or Online Python Editors) is perfect choice for the first steps in python language. PyCharm is also good but takes the help of some experienced person while using this.
Intermediate — PyCharm, Sublime, Atom, Vs Code.
Advanced — PyCharm, Vim, Emacs, Sublime, Atom, Vs Code.
What’s Your End Goal?

Web development — PyCharm Professional, VS Code
Data Science — Spyder, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm Professional
Scripting — Sublime, Atom, PyCharm Community, Eclipse + PyDev
QA — Sublime, Atom, PyCharm Community, Jupyter Notebook
What is Your Environment/OS?

Linux, macOS — PyCharm, Sublime, Atom, Vim, Jupyter
Windows — Sublime, VS Code, Eclipse + PyDev, PyCharm
Multiple/mixed OS — PyCharm, Sublime, Atom
Which Hardware Do You Have?

Bad — IDLE, Atom, Sublime, Online Editor
Good — PyCharm, VS Code, Eclipse + PyDev
Note: We have considered limited terms but it also depends on budget, git integration, teamwork, previous programming knowledge.
